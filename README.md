## Take Home Technical Test
### Question 1 - Build A To Do List Application
* #### Tech Pre-requisites
		HTML, CSS, Javascript
		Functional Requirements
		
* ### Every item in the list should have
		* Title
		* Description
		* End date
* #### The user should be able to perform following actions on a To Do item

		Priority
		End Date
### Non-functional Requirements
* The code should be readable, maintainable, testable
* Should not use any other external library for javascript, except bootstrap
* Allowed to use ES6 or Typescript or Plain vanilla javascript Documentation to run the project
* No need to add build steps, just write down a short documentation of what build steps you would like to add and how. What tools would you use?
* Short documentation on how to run the project. Demo link will be great. You can use
* `Github/Gitlab - for sharing the code, please note incremental commits and commit messages are important`
* Netlify - for hosting demo
* No need to write any backend, please read data from JSON file Reference
You can refer to Trello for the inspirationNote

* ### Please strictly use pure javascript, no other framework.
		Please write down the names of frontend libraries/frameworks that you think could have been used instead of plain javascript. And how it
		would have helped this plain vanilla javascript project with those libraries.
		Let us know the top 10 learning resources that you follow to enhance your coding skills.
		
## Question 2 - First Variation on Caesar Cipher
`The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter (plaintext letters are from 'a' to 'z' or from 'A' to 'Z') with a different one a fixed
number of places up or down the alphabet.
This program performs a variation of the Caesar shift. The shift increases by 1 for each character (on each iteration).
If the shift is initially 1, the first character of the message to be encoded will be shifted by 1, the second character will be shifted by 2, etc...`
